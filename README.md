        <li>Employed basic Python syntax in order to analyze star wars script data.</li>
        <li>Use of Python to read/ parse a raw dataset, convert data types, apply if statements, and apply for loops in order to find which U.S. city has the least records of violent crime.</li>
        <li>Python functions to parse data, apply if statements, and create a dictionary in order to calculate the frequency of different weather conditions in Los Angeles.</li>
        <li>Python functions which tokenize string data, check for syntax and index errors, and normalize data dictionaries in order to provide a check for spelling errors within text data.</li>
        <li>Employed modules and classes in Python, while analyzing data from (American) football from 2009-2013.</li>
        <li>Use of the enumerate function, list comprehensions, try/except blocks, and the None type in Python, while finding the most common names for US Congressman/Congresswomen.</li>
        <li>Python functions to create a while loop, use the break keyword, and add named and optional arguments, in order to a function in order to find which U.S. airlines have the most delays.</li>
        <li>Use of scopes and debugging in Python while analyzing student loan defaults in the U.S..</li>
        <li>Object oriented programming in Python, including writing organized sensible code and implementing comparison operators, to compare the average ages of players on various NBA teams.</li>
        <li>Example exception handling code in Python applied to recorded chopstick 'food pinching efficiency' data.</li>
        <li>Advanced string manipulation and anonymous functions in Python in order to assess characteristics of a list of user passwords.</li>
